- Added proper YAML front matter version headers to 4 critical foundational documents:
  - 01-product/product-vision-strategy.md (v1.0.0, Status: Approved, Owner: Product Lead, Dependencies: None)
  - 01-product/team-playbook.md (v1.0.0, Status: Approved, Owner: Engineering Lead, Dependencies: None)
