COMPREHENSIVE MVP AUDIT - 100% COVERAGE VERIFICATION

Perform exhaustive 100% MVP coverage audit of Abyrith platform (currently 85% complete).

CONTEXT (Read these files first):
1. /HANDOFF-GUIDE.md - Full project context
2. /MVP-VALIDATION-SUMMARY.md - Current validation status
3. /COMPREHENSIVE-MVP-AUDIT-SCRIPT.md - Detailed audit methodology

MISSION:
Verify EVERY component of MVP architecture is:
✅ Documented correctly
✅ Implemented in code
✅ Tested (or test plan exists)
✅ Integrated with other components
✅ Production-ready

DEPLOY 10 AGENTS IN PARALLEL (3 WAVES):

WAVE 1 - Documentation Verification (3 agents):
- Agent 1: Architecture docs vs implementation (02-architecture/ vs code)
- Agent 2: Database schemas vs migrations (04-database/ vs supabase/migrations/)
- Agent 3: API docs vs endpoints (05-api/ vs workers/src/handlers/)

WAVE 2 - Implementation Audit (4 agents):
- Agent 4: Frontend components (abyrith-app/components/**)
- Agent 5: Backend services (workers/src/**)
- Agent 6: State management (lib/stores/**)
- Agent 7: Encryption implementation (lib/crypto/envelope-encryption.ts - CRITICAL)

WAVE 3 - Integration Verification (3 agents):
- Agent 8: Auth flow (signup → login → master password → secrets)
- Agent 9: Secret CRUD (create → encrypt → store → fetch → decrypt → display)
- Agent 10: UI/UX flows (all user journeys complete)

CRITICAL AREAS TO VERIFY:

🔐 SECURITY (MUST BE 100%):
- Envelope encryption: 5 DB fields, KEK salt cached, master password never transmitted
- RLS policies: All 9 tables, multi-tenancy enforced
- Zero-knowledge: Client-side encryption only, server cannot decrypt

📊 DATABASE:
- All 9 tables exist with correct schema
- Migrations are idempotent and ordered
- Indexes created, triggers applied
- TypeScript types match schema

🎨 FRONTEND:
- All documented components exist
- Auth guards work correctly
- State management complete (Zustand + React Query)
- Loading/error states implemented

⚙️ BACKEND:
- API endpoints match documentation
- Rate limiting applied
- Error handling comprehensive
- Environment variables documented

🧪 TESTING:
- Unit tests for encryption exist (or create test plan)
- Integration test strategy defined
- Manual testing checklist complete

OUTPUT REQUIRED:

Create comprehensive report with:
1. Executive Summary (MVP % complete, critical blockers, priorities)
2. Domain-by-Domain Results (Security, DB, Frontend, Backend, Testing)
3. Integration Verification (complete user journey traces)
4. Gap Analysis Table:
   | Feature | Documented? | Implemented? | Tested? | Status | Priority |
5. Actionable Next Steps (prioritized by urgency)
6. Confidence Assessment (scores + overall readiness %)

FILES TO CREATE:
- /COMPREHENSIVE-MVP-AUDIT-REPORT.md - Full results
- /MVP-GAP-ANALYSIS.md - Detailed gaps
- /PRODUCTION-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md - Final pre-launch checklist

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Every documented feature has implementation
✅ Every implemented feature has documentation
✅ All integrations verified working
✅ Security model 100% implemented
✅ No critical blockers
✅ MVP readiness >= 95%

TIME ESTIMATE: 60 minutes (10 parallel agents + consolidation)

THEN BASED ON RESULTS:
- If >= 95%: Proceed with deployment
- If 85-94%: Fix high-priority gaps (2-8 hours)
- If < 85%: Escalate to user

USE PARALLEL AGENTS AGGRESSIVELY - Be thorough - Focus on MVP scope only

DEPLOY NOW! 🚀
